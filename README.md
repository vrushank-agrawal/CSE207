# CSE207

This folder contains all assignments for CSE207 at Ecole Polytechnique for the year 2021-22.

- There were 5 TD's and a secret assignment which are placed in their respective folders appropriately named. For those who are concerned about the grades, I got 20/20 for all the labs and the project. Still, my solutions are not perfect and Nhat and Tung did write better code.
- The `Quizzes_vrushank.pdf` containes the answers to all the quizzes asked to me in the course. The answers marked are correct for all quizzes except maybe the last ones for which we did not have solutions. I tried to answer as best as I can but one or two options might be wrong. Although these questions will probably be changed next year, the files can hopefully provide an insight for what to expect from the quizzes. Same goes for Minh Tung's file.
- The `Final_Notes.md` file are the notes that Nhat Vo, Minh Tung, and I created for the final exam. These notes are quite comprehensive and one need not look further from them for this course. You are still welcome to update them as per your looking and create a pull request if you wish or not.
